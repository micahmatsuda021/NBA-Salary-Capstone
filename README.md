# NBA Salary Prediction Capstone

For many, watching the NBA is an exciting time of their year. They see their favorite players play the game they love and put on a show for entertainment at each stadium and viewers at home. Now because of the fans, the NBA's revenue topped over $10 Billion last year for the first time. With revenue at an all-time high, what does that mean for the players who put on the show? 

In this project, I will be analyzing data from a NBA player's first contractâ€™s stats and their salary for their second contract to create a model to predict incoming players' salaries based on their previous stats. It is always fun to see how much players are getting to put on a show for viewers, and my goal throughout this project is to build an effective model to accurately determine how much someone can make in their next contract.
